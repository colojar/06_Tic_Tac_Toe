Oh Noe - Tic Tac Toe

Design a classic Tic Tac Toe game game where the user can make turns against an AI. The user will be asked to place a symbol
and your program should insert it into a multidimensional grid. After each turn an AI should also make its turn and the
program detects when someone wins (or if there is a tie!)

Do not place all your code in the program.cs but instead create additional separate files that handle all the functions for
user interface (like Console.ReadLine and WriteLine) and logic.

(create UI.cs and Logic.cs to place your methods)

rocket Tips: Utilize the things you have learned in the slotmachine about multidimensional arrays and also your knowledge
about ui - logic split using functions
